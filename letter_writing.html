  <h1> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
  <p> Dear Eileen,<br><br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Aweseome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="doctor of philosophy"> PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your question one by one, in following sections.
  </p>
  <h3>Starting dates</h3>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us before if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 september 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefere.<br> You can find more information about <a href="hhtps://www.google.com">important university dates</a> on our website.
  </P>
  <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
  <p>
    At the Awesome science faculty, we have a prety open-minded research facility - as long
    as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
    intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our
    team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
    in order of priority:
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk baseplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup><sup style="font-size:50%">o</sup></sup>C(86<sup><sup style="font-size:50%">o</sup></sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup><sup style="font-size:70%">3</sup></sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup><sup style="font-size:70%">4</sup></sup>.)</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  So please can you provide more information on eaach of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
  </p>
  <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dance. To answer your question,my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
  </p>
  <pre>
    Polynesian chicken dance
          A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
          in a circle like chickens, to encourage thier livestock to be <q>fruitfull</q>.
   </pre>
  <pre>
  Icelandic brown shuffle
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling thier bodies around in imperceptibly
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
        modern styles such as Twerking
  </pre>
  <pre>Arctic robot dance
             An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
             discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
             of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just like this
             because they were really cold.
